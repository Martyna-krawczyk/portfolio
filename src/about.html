      <h1>What have I been up to?</h1>
    <p>I have been very fortunate to have been accepted into a program offered by MYOB called DevelopHer, which included a scholarship to Coder Academy's Fast Track Diploma of IT.  The course will leave me with everything I need to become a  a full stack developer, including ruby, css, html, rails, javascript, react, the MERN stack (). </p>

            <p>Adminflow evolved from an operation support service, to efficiency and systemisation consulting for SMBs.  Technology is such an important asset that many businesses haven't yet implemented and it was clear that they needed systems support first.
